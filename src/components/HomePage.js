          <h2>2024 Lok Sabha elections: India's roll call of democracy</h2>
          <p>A day before the 17th Lok Sabhaa had its last sitting amidst parting speeches, India's list of electors that will choose the 18th Lok Sabha was announced. It could be coincidental but has a meaning at the depth, if not as dramatic as the dumping of the electoral bonds. Special Summary Revision (SSR 2024) has thrown up a new electoral roll of 968.8 million registered voters whose choice will be unleashed in the impending summer.

The number is more than the population of Europe, and of the continents of North and South America put together. This multitude of ordinary citizens, above the age of 18, armed with suffrage gifted by the Constitution, will decide the government for next five years. There were 911 million electors in the 2019 elections and 834 million in 2014. In the first election in 1951, the electorate was only 173 million, but still made it the largest election at that time</p>

          <h2>Listen: Indian PM Modi is expected to get a rockstar welcome in the U.S. How much is the diaspora fuelling him?</h2>
          <p>On June 22, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will make his first official state visit to the United States. And if his visits to Australia last month, to Canada in 2015 and to Texas in 2019 are any indication, he’ll be given a rockstar welcome.

U.S. President Joe Biden has already joked that he wants Modi’s autograph because so many people want to see the Indian PM while he’s in the United States.

Of course, Modi has his critics too, who point to the populist leader’s far-right policies and human rights abuses.

Yet, as the prime minister of the world’s largest democracy, Modi remains one of the world’s most popular leaders - not just at home, but among the tens of millions who make up the global South Asian diaspora.

Last week, perhaps in an acknowledgement of the power of the South Asian diaspora on Indian elections, the former leader of the opposition, Rahul Gandhi, also visited the United States.</p>
